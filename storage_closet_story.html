                    Working in IT can come with many challenges. One of which is keeping a well organized stock room. While I was at Stone Plastics, this was no exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many times, when a piece of equipment was needed,
                    you would go up there and look for it to only come up blank or you would have to wade through a mountain of trash to get what you were looking for.
                    To many of you, these images might look familiar in terms of your current IT storage solution.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My education background is in manufactured quality and chemistry. I always knew the IT storage closet was a bit insane where I worked.
                    One day the regular IT guy went on vacation giving me the opportunity to to dive in to organization under the 5S methodology.
                </p>
                <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_(methodology)" title="Click to see the Wikipedia entry1">The 5S Methodology</a></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>S</b>ort</li>
                    <li><b>S</b>et in Order</li>
                    <li><b>S</b>hine</li>
                    <li><b>S</b>tandardize</li>
                    <li><b>S</b>ustain</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I was told by one of the controls engineers that while I might spend some time organizing the IT storage closet, it wouldn't stay clean.
                    It would have to be done periodically. I don't think this is gonna be the case, and it is not because of the people I worked with.
                    It is because the many times before when it was cleaned, no standard was created to sustain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, every box is labeled with a title and a picture. Inside every box, every cable is <span id="show_coiling" onmouseover="show_coiling()" onmouseout="hide_coiling()">coiled and bound</span> too keep things from tangling.
                    In addition to that I also created a <span id="show_kanban" onmouseover="show_kanban()" onmouseout="hide_kanban()">kanban card</span> system to help make sure people never had to wait on a cable to set something up.
                </p>
                <span>
                    <img src="assets/img/storage_closet/box_inside.JPG" id="coilingimage" alt="coiled up cables">
                </span>
                <span>
                    <img src="assets/img/storage_closet/kanban.JPG" id="kanbanimage" alt="Kanban cards">
                </span>
                <p>
                    The persons before me didn't standardize the area, and you can't sustain your sort or set in order without standardization. Following months of work, these were the results.
                </p>
