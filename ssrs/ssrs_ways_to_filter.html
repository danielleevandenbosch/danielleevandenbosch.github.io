            I guess my point would be, just use a SQL statement expression. It is faster and standardized. You were most likely just writing your SQL Statement in a text editor. So just add the <code>WHERE</code> clause there. You will also be less likely to forget to add the parameters to the WHERE clause as well because your sql statement won't work without them
